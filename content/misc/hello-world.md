All Tamanduas share a fascination for ants: the usual Tamandua (meaning
"anteater" in both Tupi and Portuguese) tends to see them as a tasty
snack. This Tamandua however, uses ants - a common metaphor for
agents - to analyze a complex system. When observing natural ant
colonies it can easily be seen that the complexity of each single ant is
rather low. Nonetheless ant colonies exhibit complex behavior and have
even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems.
Water allocation management in a river catchment is another example
of such a complex system: relatively simple actions and decisions of
autonomous stakeholders can lead to complex water scarcity patterns.
Tamandua aims to increase insight in what is going on in the "ant colony
of water allocation".
