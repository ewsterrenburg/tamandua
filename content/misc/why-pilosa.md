It’s humans that are the most curious animal on the planet.

This thesis addresses the interdependencies between water use and water
 availability and describes a model that has been developed to increase
 insight in the potential effects of different decentralization regimes
 in water allocation management with regard to the spatial and temporal
 distribution of water availability and agricultural water use in a
 semi-arid river basin.
 
 Relevant processes include physical processes such as hydrological processes,
 water user responses to variations and changes in water availability and social processes
 between water users and water managers.
 
 The results are relevant for research on relevant initial condition,
 context factors and design principles for participative river basin management.
 Water demand, water allocation management and water availability are strongly
 related in semi-arid environments, where the irrigation sector is responsible
 for a large part of consumptive water use. Variations in water abstractions
 for irrigation depend on irrigated area and irrigation requirements per hectare.


> All Tamanduas share a fascination for ants: the usual Tamandua (meaning
> "anteater" in both Tupi and Portuguese) tends to see them as a tasty
> snack. This Tamandua however, uses ants - a common metaphor for
> agents - to analyze a complex system. When observing natural ant
> colonies it can easily be seen that the complexity of each single ant is
> rather low. Nonetheless ant colonies exhibit complex behavior and have
> even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems.
> Water allocation management in a river catchment is another example
> of such a complex system: relatively simple actions and decisions of
> autonomous stakeholders can lead to complex water scarcity patterns.
> Tamandua aims to increase insight in what is going on in the "ant colony
> of water allocation".

##Why this name?
Plan was to use tamandua:
a name I came up with for .. model developed during my graduation ... fond of ever since.
