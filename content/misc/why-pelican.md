summary: Short explanation on why this blog is written using pelican

The idea of a personal website and blog has been floating around in my 
head for a long long time. Most of this time, I expected the result
to be powered by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/ "Django") /
[Mezzanine](http://mezzanine.jupo.org/ "Mezzanine").

When I finally decided to put thing into action and was almost finished,
the result felt like overkill for the simple needs. A little internet 
research provided a whole world of static site generators which seemed
more appropriate for a site like this. Among these, I've chosen
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/ "Pelican") for the following reasons:

- Simple, lightweight, hosting
- Written in familiar language (python) and using a familiar template system (jinja2)
- Elaborate documentations and plenty of blog posts describing how to use and customize pelican
- Pelicans are awesome![^staticgenerators]

Biggest drawback of this approach is that the ...
Most common .. is to use disqus, : disqus, but let's give it a try 
> Fifty million Frenchmen can't be wrong

##Why this theme?
Originally, plan was to do a dark color scheme, with some fractal themings.
When going through the Pelican themes, the pure theme proved to be beautifully simple.
The only drawback was a severe shortage of bananas, but that was easy
enough to solve. Bananas improve everything.

[^staticgenerators]: Although good names seem to be common among static site generators: 
[Nikola Tesla](http://getnikola.com/) and [Octopuses](http://octopress.org/) awesome as well!
